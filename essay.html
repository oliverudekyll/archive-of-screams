        While the political T-shirt is nothing new, stemming from the likes of
        Katherine Hamnett, using clothing as a tool for protest or just a canvas
        for sending a message within usually marginalised communities, it is
        noteworthy that this trend tends to (re)emerge often in times of great
        precarity and political, sociological and environmental hardship. Today,
        the trend of wearing political T-shirts is very much alive and kicking,
        and often taking a more straightforward and blunt tone than it has
        before. While some examples may seem to be sending mixed or altogether
        confusing messages (think of shirts saying &ldquo;I hate sex&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;I love being a girl online&rdquo;) however what they speak to as
        a whole, is this generation's acute need to be heard, not necessarily
        through verbally saying anything. In a world where everything is
        politicised, choosing to make a statement through clothing, no matter
        how direct or opaque, is a way of taking ownership of our own bodies,
        our own communities and the people within them, and maybe, just maybe,
        sending a message to someone on the outside.

        In a world where every facet of existence is irrevocably politicised,
        the act of inscribing one's beliefs upon the fabric of their attire
        assumes a profound significance. Through this act of sartorial
        proclamation, individuals assert ownership not only over their bodies
        but also over the collective narratives that shape their communities.
        Within these images lie not only stories of defiance and dissent but
        also whispers of solidarity, beckoning outsiders to heed the silent
        clamour of a generation seeking to be heard. Welcome to the Archive of
        Screams, where every garment tells a tale, and every photograph captures
        a moment of resonant significance.
